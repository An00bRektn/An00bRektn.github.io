<h2 id="this-is-my-blog">This is my blog!</h2>

<p>I’m a CS student who just finished their 1st year of university, and I’ve been doing a lot of learning on my own. This blog is just a way for me to document that process.</p>

<p>Most of the content here will be writeups for ctfs, but I’m sure there’ll be other stuff too. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Disclaimer: All opinions are my own and all facts are by no means guaranteed to be truthful. But you should really just assume that about anything.</p>
