## This is my blog!

I'm a CS student who just finished their 1st year of university, and I've been doing a lot of learning on my own. This blog is just a way for me to document that process.

Most of the content here will be writeups for ctfs, but I'm sure there'll be other stuff too. Enjoy!

Disclaimer: All opinions are my own and all facts are by no means guaranteed to be truthful. But you should really just assume that about anything.
